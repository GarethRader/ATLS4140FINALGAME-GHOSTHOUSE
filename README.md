MOVEMENT SYSTEM FEATURES AND GOALS:


- WASD keys to move
- Camera follows player character from a third person view
- Jumping
- Simple collisions with built-in Unity physics engine

ISSUES:
- Camera cuts off some of the environment at the bottom of the screen (due to camera angle, will ask Matt about this...)
- Jumping could be iterated and developed more, right now is more simple jumping (not the 'floating' jump)
